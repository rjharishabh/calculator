  <li class="list-group-item"> Thanks for visiting Help for IIT! Here you’ll find lots of quizzes, tests and important articles about Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics. </li>
<li class="list-group-item">We created this site as a place for taking free tests related to IIT-JEE and the difficulty level of tests is of JEE Mains & JEE Advanced level, but after sometime we realized that we have to also add some important articles of Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics so that students read the articles of their choice and take quizzes or tests to understand the concepts in depth, but this cannot last long because if you read articles and take tests or quizzes, then you will definitely have some doubts in the concepts and if you haven't clear your doubts on a regular basis, then it likes a burden on you. Then we decided to add a discussion forum so that students can ask questions and students ( or instructors) can answer the questions, because we have to share our knowledge.
</li><li class="list-group-item">Hopefully it will provide you with a foundation of what you need . We post articles regularly in a format that’s easy to understand and includes all the information you need to completely understand the topics or concepts.
